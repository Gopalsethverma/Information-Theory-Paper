# Implementation and Performance Analysis of LDPC Codes using Belief Propagation

This repository contains the Python implementation of Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes and the Belief Propagation (BP) decoding algorithm as part of our project.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code for LDPC code construction, BP decoding, and simulation.
- `docs/`: Additional documentation.
- `results/`: Storage for simulation results and plots.
- `tests/`: Unit tests.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
